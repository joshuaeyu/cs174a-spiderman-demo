Our project is a playable game that allows a player to explore a city as Spider-Man. 
Spider-Man can move, jump, shoot webs, swing in the air, and stick to walls. 
He can also collect coins scattered around the map. 
Keyboard inputs control Spider-Manâ€™s movements while the mouse controls which direction he is facing. 

The game is run by hosting it locally and accessing via a web browser (for example Google Chrome). 

Our advanced topics were implementing physics, collision detection, and scene graphs.

The work broke down as follows: 
Justin Lee - physics engine, jumping, gravity, swinging, web
Gladys Ng - collision detection, coins, building generation, texture mapping, object placement,
axis aligned bounding boxes
Daniel Park - scene graphs, smoothing out movement, car/people design, collisions involving cars/people,
movement of cars/people
Joshua Yu - physics engine, player movement, camera movement, climbing/sticking to walls
